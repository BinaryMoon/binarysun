In Refuge Solitaire we have to sort the outer piles to the 8 decks in the middle. 4 of them in the order King-2 and the other deck from Ace-Kind. In addition we can move the cards in the tableaus on top of another as long as it has the same suit and is one lower or higher than the current value of the card to reach other cards.
