You just got off a remote mountain range after finishing a construction project when a zombie plague breaks. What do you do? What you do best off course: Build, upgrade and fight yourself out of the situation. Build barricades and tower, upgrade your weapons, and prepare yourself each day; for when the night comes, zombie horde will attack. This is KULI.
