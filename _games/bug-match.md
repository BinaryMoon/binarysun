Swap any bug with its vertical or horizontal neighbour to form a row of 3 or more matching bugs. Matching a row of bugs lights up the tiles beneath them. Light all the tiles in the grid to win the round and move on to the next level! The best scores will make it onto the high score table. Play Bug Match!
