title: Super Gerball
---
Gerry the Gerbil loves playing in his ball - he would play all day long if he could. Unfortunately though, the house in which Gerry lives is not safe - if he is not careful, he will fall and hurt himself.

You must guide Gerry around the 60 levels contained within the house, making sure he does not fall off the edge of any of them. Your job is made harder by the numerous obstacles left lying about - if Gerry touches these, he will be pushed away - and possibly off an edge.

There is also a time limit to contend with - Gerry must complete all the levels by midnight. If Gerry completes a level, he will dance a jig in celebration. It is up to you to make sure he dances all day long - and is still dancing at the end of the night.
